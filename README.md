<h2> Adventure (Text-based) Game </h2>
<p> This game is based on something that I once used to play as a child. The goal of this game is to neutralise a threat by zombies in a very prestigious hotel.</p>
<p>This game was built on some very basic programming concepts, which I will continue to build upon in the future.</p>
<p> I'm building this game slowly over time; my final commit will have the game working fully.
